Homo Deus was the most thought provoking book I've read in a long time. Yuval Harari's combination of scholarship, storytelling, and humor kept the pages turning quickly.

The author sets out to explore the near future of the human race: what will we pursue? What problems will we choose to tackle? And will we proceed cautiously enough to avoid our own doom? He contends that we will seek to live forever and engineer supreme happiness and contentment during our long lives. To be gods, above nature. 

Note that these aren't normative claims, but rather predictions of human behavior. The benefits of these advances may be available to only a select few. Indeed, as Harari warns, the underlying fabric of society could tear as a small elite become superhuman while the fundamental assumptions of Liberalism and the Enlightenment give way.

Throughout the book Harari asks the reader to question how humanism, the contemporary religion, will hold up in the face of an evolving technological and scientific landscape. For example, recent experiments in neuroscience suggest that "free will" as we usually conceive of it is pure fiction (as the author Sam Harris likes to say, even the illusion of free will is an illusion, if you pay enough attention to your subjective experience; see [this article](http://www.rifters.com/real/articles/NatureNeuroScience_Soon_et_al.pdf) by Siong Soon, et al.)

There is a case to be made that living organisms are nothing but fancy algorithms. Harari describes what could be the religion of the near future: dataism. The transition from humanism to dataism will proceed because, with good enough models and enough data, an outside party will come know us better than we know ourselves. Individual liberty becomes suspicious if there is no 'individual', but rather many separate mental processes and brain functions. If there is no free will, and if our every mood and action can be predicted or even decided, will our current political and ethical norms hold up? 

Today we entrust individual humans to give meaning to their lives, to determine who should be our leaders and what our laws should be, on the basis of our feelings and self reflection. Harari suggests that in the future, we may trust algorithms other than the ones running in our heads to do a better job. Today we treat fictional entities, like corporations and nations, as agents capable of owning things and making decisions. We used to give the same privilege to gods. Why not algorithms? 

Homo Deus provides a lively discussion of humanity's philosophical and technological evolution. While certainly frightening, Harari doesn't give the impression that our fate is sealed. However, we have to be conscious about where our quest for enlightenment through technology is taking us. I highly recommend giving it a read.
